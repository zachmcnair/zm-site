# Markdown Blog & Case Studies Setup

This document explains how to set up a markdown-based blog and case studies system for your Next.js site.

## Overview

The system allows you to:
- Write blog posts in markdown (.mdx files)
- Create case studies/portfolio pieces
- Auto-generate pages from markdown files
- Include metadata (title, date, tags, etc.)
- Support images and rich content
- Share content easily with built-in sharing buttons

## File Structure

```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/           # Blog posts (.mdx files)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ case-studies/   # Case studies (.mdx files)
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mdx.ts         # Utilities for handling markdown
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mdx.tsx        # MDX rendering components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ share-buttons.tsx # Sharing functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ feed/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ route.ts       # RSS feed generation
â””â”€â”€ blog/              # Blog pages
    â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx       # Blog listing
    â””â”€â”€ [slug]/
        â””â”€â”€ page.tsx   # Individual blog post
```

## How to Enable

1. **Install dependencies** (already done):
   ```bash
   pnpm add next-mdx-remote gray-matter date-fns
   ```

2. **Create content** by adding .mdx files to the content directories.

## Writing Content

### Blog Post Example

Create a file: `app/content/blog/my-post.mdx`

```markdown
---
title: "My Blog Post Title"
date: "2024-01-15"
description: "A brief description of the post"
tags: ["AI", "Web3", "Design"]
published: true
---

# My Blog Post

This is the content of my blog post. You can use:

## Headers
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- `Code snippets`

## Lists
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Code Blocks
```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```

## Images
![Alt text](/path/to/image.jpg)
```

### Case Study Example

Create a file: `app/content/case-studies/my-project.mdx`

```markdown
---
title: "Project Name"
date: "2024-01-10"
description: "Description of the project"
tags: ["UX Design", "Product Design", "AI"]
published: true
---

# Project Name

## Overview
Project description and goals.

## The Challenge

```

## Frontmatter Options

All .mdx files support frontmatter (the section between `---`):

- `title`: Post title (required)
- `date`: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `description`: Brief description for previews
- `tags`: Array of tags for categorization
- `image`: Featured image path
- `published`: Boolean to control visibility (default: true)

## Troubleshooting

### React Version Conflicts
If you encounter React version conflicts:
1. Check for duplicate React installations
2. Clear `.next` cache: `rm -rf .next`

These demonstrate the full range of markdown features and styling.
