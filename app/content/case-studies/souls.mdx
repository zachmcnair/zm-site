title: "SOU.LS"

description: "SOU.LS was an all-in-one app built on Eliza OS that would enable people to have a local AI agent that could be tied to an NFI (non-fungible intelligence) so that their agent could interact with the blockchain and could be interoperable (the same agent that you use to run your business could then go and build a metaverse while you sleep). It was consumer-focused — enabling folks to have ai they owned and enable them to use their ai locally, privately."
