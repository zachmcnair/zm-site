1. I’ve been quietly rebuilding [my site](https://www.zachmcnair.com) from scratch and hosting it for free. I kind of got addicted to the idea and ended up rebuilding a few other sites, which let me cancel my Framer and Squarespace subscriptions—saving me about $100/month.

2. [This book](https://www.thelasteconomy.com) by Emad Mostaque has my mind reeling. Here’s an excerpt:  
   > “Consider Johannes Trithemius, abbot of Sponheim, who in 1492 wrote a passionate treatise called *In Praise of Scribes.* He argued that the newfangled printing press was a fad, that hand-copied manuscripts were morally superior, that the sacred act of copying text brought monks closer to God. Every argument was theological, philosophical, aesthetic. None mentioned the actual reason: his monastery’s income came from copying books.  
   >
   > Within fifty years, the scriptoriums were museums. Trithemius is remembered, when he’s remembered at all, as the man who stood athwart history yelling ‘Stop!’ at a printing press.”

3. I got to be on an X Space with my buds at Augmented Imagination today. You can listen [here](https://x.com/augimagination/status/1963980473513775206).

4. [This video](https://youtu.be/eoLg14LEFVQ?si=1lecqt9-FKKAikCx) from Gary Vee about how marketing will drastically change over the next 24 months is worth a watch—if you’re into that sort of thing.

5. I recently fell down the rabbit hole of the Honda S800, and [this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNnRMAeqrbN) is a solid primer.

Catch ya on the next one. ✌️
