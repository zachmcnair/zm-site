# My Design Process

When starting a new design project, I follow a structured approach that ensures both creativity and efficiency.

## Research Phase

The first step is always understanding the problem space. This involves:

- User interviews
- Competitive analysis
- Technical constraints review

## Ideation and Sketching

Once I understand the problem, I move into rapid ideation.

The key is to explore multiple directions before committing to any single approach.

## Inspiration and Music

I often listen to music while designing. Here's a track that gets me in the creative zone:

/>

## Final Implementation

After rounds of iteration, we arrive at the final design.

This process ensures that every design decision is intentional and user-focused.
